\section{Warm up}

Lets modify the classic merge sort algorithm a little bit. What happens if instead of splitting the array in 2 parts we divide it in 3? You can assume that exists a three-way merge subroutine. What is the overall asymptotic running time of this algorithm?

\emph{BONUS:} Implement the three-way merge sort algorithm.
