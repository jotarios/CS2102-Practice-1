\section{Competitive programming}

Welcome to your first competitive programming problem!!! 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sign-up in Uva Online Judge (\url{https://uva.onlinejudge.org}) and in CodeChef if you want (we will use it later).
    \item Rest easy! This is not a contest, it is just an introductory problem. Your first problem is located in the ``Problems Section'' and is \textbf{100 - The 3n + 1 problem}.
    
    \item Once that you finish with that problem continue with \textbf{458 - The Decoder}. Again, this problem is just to build your confidence in competitive programming.
    
    \item \emph{BONUS:} \textbf{10855 - Rotated squares}
\end{itemize}
