\subsection{Define Karatsuba multiplication}

The Karatsuba (or Karatsuba-Ofman) algorithm was published in 1962 by Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba and Yuri Petr√≥vich Ofman, through their paper \textit{Multiplication of many-digital numbers by automatic computers}. 

The algorithm is defined as a recursive algorithm that shall multiply large numbers in a quickly time, almost faster than the naive method (e.g. $\Theta(n^2)$). The Karatsuba algorithm has a running time of ${\Theta(n^\log 3)}$, where ${\log}$ 3 $\approx 1.58$.
