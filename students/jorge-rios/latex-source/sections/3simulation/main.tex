\section{Simulation}

Write a program to find the minimum input size for which the merge sort algorithm always beats the insertion sort.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement the insertion sort algorithm
    \item Implement the merge sort algorithm
    \item Just compare them? No !!! Run some simulations or tests and find the average input size for which the merge sort is an asymptotically ``better'' sorting algorithm.
\end{itemize}

Note: Include (.tex) and attach(.cpp) your source code and use a dockerfile to interact with python and plot your results.\\

\emph{BONUS:} Compare both algorithms against any other sorting algorithm
